### EasyByte class
The challenge requires the manipulation of strings representing bytes in different formats (bytes, hex, bas64, ...). This class was created to easily store and manipulate data of different formats by storing all data as byte strings, so that all methods may be written for byte strings. The class can then translate the byte strings to required formats:
```python
my_bytes = EasyByte('59454c4c4f57205355424d4152494e45', 'hex')  # Store hex string
print(my_bytes.b)  # Prints b'YELLOW SUBMARINE': the above hex string is stored in byte format as self.b
print(my_bytes.convert('b64'))  # Prints 'WUVMTE9XIFNVQk1BUklORQ==', data in base 64
```
For example, it is then easy to XOR our data with data of any format:
```python
my_bytes2 = EasyByte('9454c4c4f57205355424d4152494e455', 'hex')  # Store hex string
xored_easybyte = my_bytes2.xor('zRGIiLolJWYBZplUdt2qEA==', 'b64')  # Obtain my_bytes2 XORed with a string in base64
print(xored_easybyte.convert('text'))  # Obtain result as text, in this case prints 'YELLOW SUBMARINE'
```

### Cryptopals_main
Main file which contains classes relevant for encryption/decryption. Examples are VCode for Vigen√®re ciphers and AESCode for AES.
#### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):<br>ECB, CBC and CTR encryption modes with AESCode class
An AESCode instance is used to store byte string to be encrypted/decrypted along with all information needed for encryption/decryption.
Example: Encrypt plaintext in AES-CBC mode:
```python
# Declare plaintext and key and encrypt under AES-CBC mode
encrypted = AESCode('One cappuccino please.', 'text', key=b'YELLOW SUBMARINE', iv=b'ORANGE SUBMARINE').cbc_encrypt()

# Encrypted byte is stored as an EasyByte under the attribute encrypted.easybyte
print(encrypted.easybyte.b)  # Prints encrypted byte b'\xf0f\xf0\x1e\xec]|'... 

# Plaintext can be recovered by calling the relevant solve function
print(encrypted.cbc_solve())  # Prints b'One cappuccino please.'
```
You may recognise the first two parameters (plaintext and format) as EasyByte parameters. This is because AESCode stores messages as EasyByte instances throughout.
